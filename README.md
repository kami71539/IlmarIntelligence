## Solution

/*Write a query to pull back the most recent redemption count, by redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store". Your result should have 2 columns and 7 rows (one row per day in the date range). Provide the query and then using your query result, provide answers to the following questions.*/


CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE weeklyTransactionTbl AS
/*Asumming that having multiple rows for same store and same redemption date is caused due data duplicate and we only need the latest record as per the createdatetime.*/
WITH red_ByDay as ( 
SELECT retailerId, redemptionDate, redemptionCount, row_number() over (PARTITION BY retailerId, redemptionDate ORDER BY createDateTime DESC) AS logging
FROM TblRedemptions_ByDay
WHERE redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05' -- Applying the date filter within the CTE
ORDER BY redemptionDate DESC, id -- Sort the table to optimize the join
)

SELECT retailerId, retailerName, redemptionCount, redemptionDate
FROM red_ByDay AS red_day
INNER join (SELECT DISTINCT id, retailerName FROM tblRetailers WHERE retailername = 'ABC Store') AS retailers -- Filtering for the desired store in the inner table for optimization.

Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).

Change 1 - I could use Lead or Lag function partitioning on the basis of retail id, redemptionDate, and sorting by createdatetime (asc/desc depending on lead or lag) and keep only the rows where lead/lag is null.
Change 2- I could have used subquery instead of with clause and reduced the query length.
Change 3 - I could have used left join instead of inner join and applied filter on retailer name outside the join.
